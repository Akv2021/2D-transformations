# 2D-transformations (2D01.C)
This is a basic menu driven program to perform 2D Transformation operations on a rectangle.

The operations available are :
1. Translation
2. Rotation (about origin)
3. Scaling (Magnification)
4. Shearing (Tilting)
5. Reflection (About x- axis, y-axis, y = x & y = -x lines)

The Following upgrades are in my mind:

1. Save the result of each operation and perform new operation on modified rectangle (2D02 & 2D03 were intended to achieve the same but failed :( 
2. Extend the program to a general polygon of n sides (limit 20).
3. Decrease the arguments in various functions ( Hint: Global variables ?? Only one display function ?? )

Note : You may need to change the path in initgarph() function.
